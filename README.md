Description: Module of ipython widgets for quick Nanonis File Browsing in jupyter notebook

Classes:
    imageBrowser: view SXM data and export images with information
    spectrumBrowser: view and compile DAT files

the browsers are intended to be used with the line: %matplotlib widget
however, they will work with %matplotlib notebook

Optional: jupyter_launch_script.bat can be used to directly open jupyter notebooks from the windows file browser. right-click on an .ipynb file and set "open with" -> "choose another app" -> "jupyter_launch_script.bat"
